 Phase 1: Enhanced Backend WebSocket Infrastructure

  1. User Session Management
    - Add user identification to WebSocket connections
    - Create session-based message routing (private chat per user)
    - Implement connection metadata tracking
  2. Message Persistence
    - Add database models for chat history
    - Store conversations with user sessions
    - Implement message acknowledgment system
  3. Connection Health & Reliability
    - Enhance heartbeat/ping mechanism
    - Add connection timeout handling
    - Implement graceful reconnection logic

  Phase 2: Frontend WebSocket Integration

  1. Enable WebSocket by Default
    - Switch from HTTP to WebSocket in Chat view
    - Implement HTTP fallback for reliability
    - Add connection status UI indicators
  2. Persistent Chat History
    - Remove chat clearing on navigation
    - Load chat history on connection
    - Sync state between WebSocket and local storage
  3. Real-time Features
    - Typing indicators
    - Message delivery status
    - Connection quality feedback

  Phase 3: Advanced Features

  1. Security & Rate Limiting
    - WebSocket authentication during handshake
    - Per-user rate limiting
    - Input validation and sanitization
  2. Performance Optimizations
    - Message compression
    - Connection pooling
    - Batch message processing

  Implementation Strategy

  Benefits of this approach:
  - Maintains current HTTP reliability for weather/calendar
  - Provides low-latency real-time chat experience
  - Builds on existing solid WebSocket foundation
  - Allows gradual migration with fallback options

  Recommended order:
  1. Start with backend session management and persistence
  2. Enable frontend WebSocket with HTTP fallback
  3. Add real-time features and optimizations
